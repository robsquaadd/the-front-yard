# User Story

There are two scenario's for potential users of this application. One user would like to be able to able to post a item up for sale. The other is looking for a particular item to buy. Both would like this to be a peer-to-peer/yard-sale style marketplace. 

# Description

Our application was created for customers to both post items up for sale and search for items to purchase in a peer-to-peer style marketplace.

Users can create profiles, create and edit item listings, browse for products and make purchases. 

Within the user's profile, which they can create with an email address and a unique password, they will be able to create, edit and delete listings for all their different items. 

Listings will have a Title, Description, Price, Picture and the sellers contact info. 

Customers will be able to look for products by categories, see the listing information that the seller has uploaded and then reach out to the seller. When a customer clicks on the sellers e-mail address it takes them to the buyers default e-mail client and auto-populates the sellers info. 

Our application will be responsive for different screen sizes.
